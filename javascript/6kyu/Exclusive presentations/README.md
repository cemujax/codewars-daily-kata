## Description

A group of friends (n >= 2) have reunited for a get-together after a very long time.

They agree that they will make presentations on holiday destinations or expeditions they have been to only if it satisfies one simple rule:

> the holiday/journey being presented must have been visited only by the presenter and no one else from the audience.

Write a program to output the presentation agenda, including the presenter and their respective presentation titles.

## Examples

```js
presentationAgenda([
  { person: "Abe", dest: ["London", "Dubai"] },
  { person: "Bond", dest: ["Melbourne", "Dubai"] }
]) ==
  [
    { person: "Abe", dest: ["London"] },
    { person: "Bond", dest: ["Melbourne"] }
  ];

presentationAgenda([
  { person: "Abe", dest: ["Dubai"] },
  { person: "Brad", dest: ["Dubai"] }
]) == [];

presentationAgenda([
  { person: "Abe", dest: ["London", "Dubai"] },
  { person: "Bond", dest: ["Melbourne", "Dubai"] },
  { person: "Carrie", dest: ["Melbourne"] },
  { person: "Damu", dest: ["Melbourne", "Dubai", "Paris"] }
]) ==
  [{ person: "Abe", dest: ["London"] }, { person: "Damu", dest: ["Paris"] }];
```
